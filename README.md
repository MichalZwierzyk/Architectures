# Architectures
Repository presents different architectural approaches for building Android app.
It shows how architecture evolves by introducing consecutive concepts that improve its structure.
It starts with a basic View Model architecture and ends up with a variant of MVI based on Google's Architectural Components.

Path of evolution:
* View Model
* Model View Controller
* Model View Presenter
* Model View ViewModel 
* Segue (introduction of clean interfaces for each layer of MVVM)
* React (handling async operations inside Model using reactive and functional programming paradigms)
* Model View Intent
* Components (MVI implemented using Google's ViewModel and LiveData, introduction of DI and aspect-oriented programming)
